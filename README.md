# Helix Plugins(unofficial)

How it works:

*   This repo's purpose is to have a list of the most desired helix plugins.
*   You could suggest preexisting plugins from editors such as vscode, emacs,
    vim, etc. or you could describe your new plugin idea & give it a name.
*   In case you do not understand a specific plugin's purpose from just it's
    name then please refer to the "plugin description" right below or just
    click on the plugin name.
